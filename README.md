This repository contains my solution for the DeepThought
Business Analytics Role Test Drive Assignment.
The solution assumes a real small clinic where:
- Medicines are manually billed
- No barcode systems exist
- Doctor time is limited
The focus is on daily micro-audits (20–30 minutes)
that help detect errors early, control high-risk medicines,
reduce doctor dependency, and prevent month-end shocks.
This is an execution-focused solution,
not a reconciliation-heavy or MBA-style framework.
