High-risk medicines are identified based on:
- High daily sales volume
- Multiple or confusing name variations
- Frequent prescription
- High financial value
Examples:
- Dolo 650
- Azithromycin 500
- Pantoprazole 40
This step is done once and reviewed monthly.
Sales entries for high-risk medicines are reviewed daily.
Different spellings and abbreviations are mapped to one master name.
Example:
Dolo / Dolo 650 / Dolo kind → Dolo 650
New variations are noted and billing staff is informed.
Expected closing stock is calculated as:
Opening Stock + Purchases – Sales
If the difference between expected and actual stock
exceeds ±2%, it is flagged for review.
3–5 bills containing high-risk medicines are randomly checked daily.
Medicine name and quantity are verified.
Errors are logged without penalizing staff.
Errors are tracked throughout the week.
If the same error repeats three or more times,
staff retraining is initiated.
Doctor involvement is required only if:
- Financial impact is significant
- Errors continue after correction
- Inventory issues affect patient treatment
Routine issues are resolved without involving the doctor.
